    web dashboard which helps clinics in augmenting their traditional \
    consult services to patients. As a team member, I was working on \
    the web app performance fixes like lazy loading, pagination, tree \
    shaking, and after a proposal, we mandated this pattern in the \
    technical specification of any project i.e., integrating these patterns \
    as a shared functionality across the platform, additionally, my work \
    included integration testing and maintain the release cycle and developing \

      "The aim was to create better quality Bears (analyzers) by creating a tool \
      that has the ability to jump directly into Bear code and move through it \
      using a debugger interface. Every programming language follows some pattern \
      or a design pattern that they recommend to prevent any complexity and future \
      bugs, for the case of javascript you can say eslint, for python say pep8, but \
      Coala works for every language, which means coala is a global wrapper but what \
      if you are a developer at coala and you want to debug that wrapper without \
      opening the GitHub code on various browser tabs, there have to be some \
      medium to debug the coala wrapper.",
